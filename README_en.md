This is Excel macro for stage rehearsal plans.
- You can import your play script ([PSCML](http://satamame.com/pscml/) format) into the sheet, and generate Appearance Table at the same time.
- Scene names in Appearance Table are links to sluglines in the Script sheet.
- There is a separate Attendance sheet. If you put attendance info there, these sheets can refer to each other.
